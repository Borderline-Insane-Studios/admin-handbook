\chapter{Expectations}
The server is supposed to a place where people can have fun and it is the duty of its admins to ensure this. If any situation on the server is not covered in this book it is expected from you that you act appropriate.

\section{General behavior guideline}
\label{expectations:general}
(there has to be a better title...)
A clanmember is expected to act in a mature and professional manner at all times. Respect the people on the server and the people will respect you. Besides the loss of respect you might also face further consequences if you:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Abuse your powers
  \item Insult players
  \item Makes racist comments
	\item Violate the serverrules
\end{itemize}

Cheating will result in an immediate ban from the clan and the server.

\section{Forum activity}
We expect members to read the forums on a regular basis as important news will be make public there. And it is our main way to communicate. Admins that are level 60 and above also have forum duties which are covered in section \ref{responsibilities:forum}.
