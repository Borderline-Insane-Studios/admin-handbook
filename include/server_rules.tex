\chapter{Server rules}
General stuff...

\section{S\&D Server}
\subsection*{Rule 1}
\label{rules:sd:1}
\textbf{ABUSE: Excessive 3xFrag, Clays, RPG.}

Players should not be placing claymores at spawn. Period. No more than 2 claymores in any given spot, same goes for c4. Players should not be spamming spawn/rush points with 3x grenades. Finally, any player running around using a rocket as a primary, and suicide rocketing, should be warned. No exceptions. 

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{4em}
Penalty: warning \\
B3 command: !w <playername> rule1
\end{addmargin}




\subsection*{Rule 2}
\label{rules:sd:2}
\textbf{CAMPING: No excessive camping! }

Camping can be defined as sitting in spawn on offense. On defense, sitting in 1 spot surrounded by claymores. Additionally, sitting in 1 spot for more than half the round, or every round is considered camping. If you find a player doing so, warn them, and act appropriately. 

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{4em}
Penalty: warning \\
B3 command: !w <playername> rule2
\end{addmargin}

\subsection*{Rule 3}
\label{rules:sd:3}
\textbf{PLAY THE OBJECTIVE ON OFFENSE!}

If there are only one or two players remaining on offense and neither one of them attempts to reach the bomb/plant for about 30 seconds it can be considered as not playing the objective. If the player in question is under fired, pinned in a spot by the enemies or can't reach the bomb for a different understandable reason this rule does not apply.
The same goes for the defense if the bomb has been planted.

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{4em}
Penalty: warning \\
B3 command: !w <playername> rule3
\end{addmargin}

\subsection*{Rule 4}
\label{rules:sd:4}
\textbf{RESPECT ADMINS AND PLAYERS!}

Any player that is toxic, trolling, constantly causing trouble and being a nuisance should receive a warning. If an admin is being disrespectful, and the player retorts, it's your own doing. Don't dish it out if you can't take it. These players should not be warned if it's admin initiated. Constant racism towards players, and admins will also receive a warning. Continued disrespect will be continued warnings, until b3 kicks. If the player comes back and keeps being disrespectful, a temp ban will be issued, and senior admins will be contacted regarding the matter.

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{4em}
Penalty: warning, for severe cases a tempban for \textit{up to} 5 days.\\
B3 command: !w <playername> rule4 or !tb <playername> 2d rule4
\end{addmargin}

\subsection*{Rule 5}
\label{rules:sd:5}
\textbf{NO HACKING / GHOSTING}

Any player suspected of hacking or ghosting will be in violation of NRU rules, and removed from the game. Please make sure that you comply with the admin protocol on bannings described in chapter \ref{protocol:banning}.

If you suspect someone of cheating and want to communicate this to the other admins without informing the player in question about this, it's recommended to do a !list to obtain the players playernumber (in the example we will use player number 3) and then type in the chat: something like \textbf{<3><} or \textbf{3 <><}  or \textbf{3@<><}

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{4em}
Penalty: tempban for 2d or permban (depending on admin level)\\
B3 command: !tb <playername> 2d rule5 or !pb <playername> rule5
\end{addmargin}

\subsection*{Rule 6}
\label{rules:sd:6}
\textbf{ENGLISH ONLY!}

This rule is pretty self explaining. However try to make sure the player is actually speaking in a different language and not slamming on a (possibly non-english) keyboard in rage.

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{4em}
Penalty: warning \\
B3 command: !w <playername> rule6
\end{addmargin}

\subsection*{Additional rules}
\subsubsection{Scripting / Scrolling}
Scripting or scrolling is not permitted on the server and will be strictly punished. The punishment depends on the behaviour of the player in question and is at admins discretion.

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{4em}
Penalty: warning, for severe cases a tempban for \textit{up to} 5 days.\\
B3 command: !w <playername> ns or !tb <playername> 2d ns
\end{addmargin}


\section{TDM Server}
Currently we have the same set of rules on both servers. So there is nothing special to remember for the TDM server.
