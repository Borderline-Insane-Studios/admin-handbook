### General stuff:

The text needs to be written in the tex files. If you want to start a new paragraph just leave a blank line. I have already included some formatting syntax that you can recycle if needed.

If you have trouble formatting it just leave a text notice at that point and I will do the formatting.
The 'language' is Tex or LaTeX and pretty much every problem can be easily solved with any searchengine or your choice.
Below you can find the links to the chapters. Subchapters etc are contained within those files - just take a look its really not that complicated.

If you want to apply your changes to the pdf file you will need to compile the project. All you need to do for that is install the environment and follow a random tutorial. Again not that hard - all i have to do is click one button.
If your changes are submitted you can also ask me to update the file.

You can download the current version here: https://github.com/Borderline-Insane-Studios/admin-handbook/blob/master/admin_handbook.pdf?raw=true
