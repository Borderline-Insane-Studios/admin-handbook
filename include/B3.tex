\section{Troubleshooting}
\label{b3:troubleshooting}

\subsection{Warnings for admin impersonating}
If you get warned for admin impersonating please remove your tags and inform any level 100 admin. There is a bug in B3 that causes the admin level to be reset, so this is nothing to worry about.

\subsection{Warnings for not wearing a tag}
If you get warned for not wearing a tab please add the tag to your name. This usually happens after the bug described above is fixed by an admin or after you have been marked as a clanmember in the system for the first time.
